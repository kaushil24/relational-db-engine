2. Internal Record Format
- Record format: We're using a variation of approach-4 where:
	- attributeOffset: sotres where each slot points the offset of individual field in record data
	- recorData: Data coming in from the user.

---------- Record Representation ----------------

               attribOffset
                    |  
formatted record: |5 9|0  12  23
           bytes:       1   5   9

-------------------------------------------------




3. Page Format


- Page footer: Page size is 4096 out of which:
	- Large 4 bytes are reserved by slotNumber
	- Last 8-4 reserved for nextRecordWritePtr which says from where the next record should be written
	- All subsequent bytes sotre the pointer where the record (that belongs to that slotId) starts
	
- Footer representation:
	|slotId2|slotId1|nextRecordWritePtr|slotCount|




4. Implementation Detail
For project 1 we made multiple assumptions, in order to have a more organized file system. First, we considered an unique
infinite file wiath capacity to store as many pages as it gets, every page with a size of 4096 bytes, within every page the
number of records might vary depending on how much space is needed for the varchar field. At the end of every page there's a
footer in which information about the slots within the page is recorded.
