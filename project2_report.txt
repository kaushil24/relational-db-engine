2. Meta-data
- "Tables" rows:
    - table-id
    - table-name
    - file-name
    - system-table: 1 if it is system table.

- "Coluns" rows:
    - table-id
    - column-name
    - column-type
    - column-length
    - column-position
    - column-exists


3. Internal Record Format
- Record format: We're using a variation of approach-4 where:
	- attributeOffset: sotres where each slot points the offset of individual field in record data
	- recorData: Data coming in from the user.

---------- Record Representation ----------------

               attribOffset
                    |  
formatted record: |5 9|0  12  23
           bytes:       1   5   9

-------------------------------------------------


4. Page Format


- Page footer: Page size is 4096 out of which:
	- Large 4 bytes are reserved by slotNumber
	- Last 8-4 reserved for nextRecordWritePtr which says from where the next record should be written
	- All subsequent bytes sotre the pointer where the record (that belongs to that slotId) starts
	
- Footer representation:
	|slotId2|slotId1|nextRecordWritePtr|slotCount|


5. File Format
- Each table has its own file. The file-name is stored in the Table table.


6. Implementation Detail
- All the interaction with pages happen through the RBFM layer. There are certain pre-requisits that the RBFM layer requires.
